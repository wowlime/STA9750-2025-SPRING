The policies we will be looking at are as follows:\n\nCapping Salaries at Mayoral Level: This proposal from CATS is a traditional policy that is implementented in many other governments already but not yet in the city of New York. Implimenting this policy could potentially save the city money but can lead to more problems down the line.\nIncreasing Staffing to Reduce Overtime Expenses: This policy suggests hiring additional employees to reduce excessive overtime pay. There are many employees that work many overtime hours which leads to higher payroll costs and by hiring more employees,and overall it could reduce overtime expenses.\nAdjusting Pay Based on Geographic Location: Our suggestion to CATS to effectively save city payroll is to adjust salaries based on the work location borough to reflect on living costs where some may have a higher cost of living while others have lower."

We also researched to see the top 10 employees, agencies, and titles affected by the change. The agencies that would be most affected by the policy change would be the Office of the Comptroller, Police Department, Office of the Mayor, and Fire Department and would directly affect over 400 people. According to our calculations, if the policy were to go through the total amount saved throughout all the years documented in the dataset would be $8,958,853, and it would affect 451 jobs.\n\nPolicy 1 Recommendation:\nWe would recommend for CATS to not go through with this policy because although it would significantly reduce payroll costs and prevent excessive overtime spending, it is not worth the risk of employee dissatisfaction which may lead to people quitting their jobs for better paying private sector jobs. Public safety agencies such as the NYPD or Fire Department may need the overtime pay to function effectively so limiting their compensation could lead to staff shortages. Instead of completely capping salaries at mayoral level, there can be a compromise where non-essential workers pay can be capped at the mayoral level while critial roles do not have that cap applied to them."

Although the potential savings are high, it would be difficult for every missing job to be filled.\nPolicy 2 Recommendation\nWe believe that this policy is not very feasible because of the sheer number new full time employees are needed for certain jobs. Just Police Officers themselves worked over 60,000,000 hours of overtime, and that would require almost 30,000 new full time Police Officers if they wanted to cut overtime expenses totally out from that title. We would recommend limiting the amount of overtime hours an employee can have, with a maximum of 10% of their regular hours. Excess hours will not be paid as overtime but as regular hours. Another suggestion is increasing staffing in smaller agencies and roles first and continually monitor it to see how much payroll is saved and scale it if it is successful."

    "text": "Policy 3: Adjusting Pay Based on Geographic Location \nTo analyze our suggestion to CATS, we looked at only 4 boroughs which were Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Bronx because the dataset did not have Staten Island in it. Through our analysis we are comparing salaries across boroughs and estimating savings by reducing salaries in lower-cost areas.\n\n\nCode\n#consolidating data to only the 4 boroughs\nnyc_boroughs &lt;- c(\"Manhattan\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Queens\", \"Bronx\")\nnyc_data &lt;- df |&gt; \n  filter(work_location_borough %in% nyc_boroughs)\n#finding the average salary per borough\nborough_salary_nyc &lt;- nyc_data |&gt; \n  group_by(work_location_borough) |&gt; \n  summarize(avg_base_salary = mean(base_salary, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\nkable(borough_salary_nyc, caption = \"Average Base Salary for NYC Boroughs\")\n\n\n\nAverage Base Salary for NYC Boroughs\n\n\nwork_location_borough\navg_base_salary\n\n\n\n\nBronx\n51598.13\n\n\nBrooklyn\n55627.04\n\n\nManhattan\n40990.79\n\n\nQueens\n54643.50\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#finding lowest cost borough\nlowest_cost_borough &lt;- borough_salary_nyc |&gt; \n  filter(avg_base_salary == min(avg_base_salary)) |&gt; \n  pull(work_location_borough)\nprint(paste(\"Lowest-Cost Borough:\", lowest_cost_borough))\n\n\n[1] \"Lowest-Cost Borough: Manhattan\"\n\n\nCode\n#adjusteding salaries by lowering it by 10% if it was not in the lowest cost borough\nadjusted_salaries &lt;- nyc_data |&gt; \n  left_join(borough_salary_nyc, by = \"work_location_borough\") |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    adjusted_salary = ifelse(\n      work_location_borough != lowest_cost_borough,\n      base_salary * 0.9,  \n      base_salary\n    ),\n#calculating salary reductions\n    salary_reduction = pmax(0, base_salary - adjusted_salary)\n  )\n#calculating total savings from the reductions\ntotal_savings &lt;- sum(adjusted_salaries$salary_reduction, na.rm = TRUE)\npaste(\"Total Potential Savings by Adjusting Salaries:\", dollar(total_savings))\n\n\n[1] \"Total Potential Savings by Adjusting Salaries: $7,793,789,406\"\n\n\nCode\nsavings_by_borough &lt;- adjusted_salaries |&gt; \n  group_by(work_location_borough) |&gt; \n  summarize(total_savings = sum(salary_reduction, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(total_savings))\nkable(savings_by_borough, caption = \"Potential Savings by Borough\")\n\n\n\nPotential Savings by Borough\n\n\nwork_location_borough\ntotal_savings\n\n\n\n\nQueens\n3398011415\n\n\nBrooklyn\n2916892892\n\n\nBronx\n1478885099\n\n\nManhattan\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy 3 Recommendation\nAs we can see from the analysis, since Manhattan is the lowest cost borough by a massive amount so they do not get a reduction in salary while the other 3 boroughs get a reduction. We decided that the reduction would be 10% of their base salaries and it would be almost $8,000,000 in potential savings if the policy were to go through. This change would be beneficial for CATS as they are looking to cut payroll costs."

    "text": "Conclusion \nOverall based on our analysis of the payroll data, New York City’s payroll policies need some sort of reform to cut costs but also needs to be balanced to keep employee retention high. Capping salaries at the mayoral level may have the potential of losing highly skilled employees in their respective fields. Increasing staff is difficult to do when overtime plays a big role in some of these jobs and it is not possible to fill in all the overtime hours with new full time employees. Adjusting pay based on the borough allows for fair compensation aligning with different costs of living. To cut down on payroll spending and optimize the taxpayer’s money we recommend a hybrid combination of the recommendations to maintain financial sustanability in New York city."
